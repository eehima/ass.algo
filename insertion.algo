Create a container to hold the stack of cards
We start from the second element (i-1) and consider it as the current element to be inserted.
Go through the cards element by element
We compare the current element with the previous elements, and check if the previous is lesser than the current element, we move the previous element one position ahead.
We go over step 4 until we find an element smaller than or equal to the current element.
We then place the current element in the correct position.
We repeat this process for all elements in the array.
